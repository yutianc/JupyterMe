# pythonsp500-plotly-dash
This repo contains the Jupyter notebook and Python script with the full code for my "Python for Finance:  Plotly Dash" post, as well as the excel file initially read in as the sample portfolio, using pandas, and the csv files generated from the Jupyter notebook.  Using a virtual environment, Python 3.6, and the libraries listed in the requirements.txt file, you can run a Plotly Dash dashboard locally based on the csv files generated from the Jupyter notebook.

To recreate the entire analysis, I recommend setting up a virtual environment (described below), loading the requirements.txt file into the virtual environment (also described below), and ``pip install`` or ``conda install`` any additional packages -- the explanations for how to accomplish all of this should either be described below or provided in the virtual environment link below.

2. Personal blog:  https://kdboller.github.io/2018/07/13/python-for-finance-plotly-dash.html

## Getting set up

1. Clone this repository:  ``git clone https://github.com/kdboller/pythonsp500-plotly-dash``; or 
2. Hit 'Clone or download' on the main repo page in order to grab the Jupyter notebook, python script and the sample excel file.

## Note on Anaconda distribution and Python Notebook

I highly recommend that you download the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).  You can also run the notebook without Anaconda using ``pip`` to install the required packages, however Anaconda is the industry standard for data science.

## Python Version and Virtual Environments  
It is recommended that you have Python 3.6 or greater so that you can run the Plotly Dashboard locally with the provided csv files.  

I strongly recommend setting up a virtual environment. I manage all of my virtual environments with Anaconda.  

[Here](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-you-need-python-environments-and-how-to-manage-them-with-conda-85f155f4353c) is a very thorough explanation on how to set up virtual environments within Anaconda.

## Requirements
For any packages not distributed under Anaconda, e.g., the Yahoo Finance package fix, you can do the following in your virtual environment:  ``pip install [name of package]``.
